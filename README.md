# SSR React Adventure

## About

For now, I'm just using this repo to experiment with React server-side rendering. ðŸ§ª

## Notes

* ESM usage without `"type": "module"` in *package.json* is due to CommonJS transformation by Parcel via *@babel/preset-env*.

* [ssg branch](https://github.com/jtellis/ssr-react-adventure/tree/ssg): static site generation with JSON data proof-of-concept
